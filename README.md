Code and data files for https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.107.064214. This project was done in collaboration with Dr. Adrian van Kan, Dr. Ben Foster, and Professor Edgar Knobloch at UC Berkeley. I would like to especially thank Adrian for mentoring me in nonlinear dynamics and the basics of numerical simulation. Most of the code was developed from scratch or with guidance from Adrian van Kan. The high performance C++ direct numerical simulation code is adapted from previous code from Nicol√°s Verschueren van Rees.
